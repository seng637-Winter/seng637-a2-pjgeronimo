# 1 Introduction

This assignment serves as an introduction to JUnit and Mock objects. The SUT is JFreeChart, which is a Java framework that helps create various types of charts.

The first step in the test plan is to decide which methods will be tested. All 5 methods from the DataUtilities class will be tested, and 5 out of 15 methods from the Range class will be tested.

The next step would be to explore the given Javadoc for each class, and determine the purpose of each method. We should familiarize ourselves with the purpose of the class itself, along with the purpose of the methods to be tested. For each method, we should also familiarize ourselves with the arguments, return values, and their data types. Knowing the purpose of each method, we can come up with our equivalence classes and boundary values.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

The design of test cases considered black-box testing methodologies where the internal structure of the method being tested is not known so we rely on specifications and requirements. For our designs, input data is partitioned into different equivalence classes, where each class represents a set of inputs that should be treated similarly by the system. This way, the tests ensure that each class of inputs, including both typical and edge cases, is adequately covered but not excessivily tested through every possibility.

Boundary value analysis complements this by focusing on the extreme edges of these equivalence classes. Since errors are more likely to occur at the boundaries, tests are designed to test these limits, such as the smallest and largest possible inputs or the transition from positive to negative values.

The use of Mocking in this lab is a strategic choice to isolate the unit of code under test. By simulating dependencies or external factors, mocking allows for the precise testing of the unit's functionality in a controlled environment. This is beneficial for pinpointing errors and ensuring the unit's functionality independently of external systems. The drawbacks is it introduces complexities such as potential false positives if mocks do not accurately represent accurate scenarios, and increased maintenance and time needed as the mocks require setup and may need to be updated if changed in the future.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

10 methods required test development so the work was divided so each member was designated 2 methods. Once the 2 methods were designed and developed, the other group members will review all the test cases developed ensuring comments are easy to understand, there are not errors when ran, and that the tests capture the main functionality as expeceted in the javadoc.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

One interesting challenge that came up was during testing the DataUtilities class. When testing caclulateColumnTotal, Values2D.getRowCount was used to create the mock Values2D object. However, when testing calculateRowTotal, using Values2D.getRowCount to create the mock object resulted in an error. Instead, Values2D.getColumnCount was used to create the mock object.

Additionally we encontered an challenge while testing combining two ranges in the Range.combine method because the test written, even though it is correct, it is interrupted from executing. This happens because the comnbine method itself is miscalculating the lower and upper bounds and attemps to create a Range where lower bound is higher than upper bound throwing IllegalArgumentException preventing the test case to finalize and assert the expected values.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

This lab served as a good introduction to JUnit and JMock. While Javadoc is already a familiar concept, exploring documentation with the intent of designing test cases provided a new, interesting perspective. The assignment guideline itself was very clear and easy to follow, which allowed for a smooth setup and better focus on designing the tests themselves.
